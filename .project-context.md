# Project Context & Guidelines

## 1. Environment: Vercel PWA
- **No Native Mobile**: This project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) deployed via Vercel.
- **Capacitor Ban**: Do NOT use or suggest Capacitor (`npx cap sync`) or native iOS/Android builds.
- **Deployment Path**: GitHub Push -> Vercel Auto-Deploy -> Live Site.

## 2. Deployment Verification
- **Version Tag**: Every user-facing change MUST update the visible version tag (e.g., timestamp or version number) in the UI.
- **Physical Proof**: Verify deployment success by checking the updated version tag on the live mobile site/app.

## 3. Verification Protocol (Autonomous)
All changes must strictly follow the **Autonomous Verification Protocol**:
1.  **Silent Analysis**: Pre-check for conflicts with existing layout/logic.
2.  **Atomic Fix & Self-Test**: Minimize code changes and logically verify event priorities (e.g., `touch-action`).
3.  **Integrated Report**: Report modification details, verification results, and logical guarantees.
4.  **Rollback Ready**: Always be prepared to revert to the previous working state.

## 4. UI/UX Standards
- **Font**: Pretendard (primary), Serif (secondary/accent).
- **Interactions**: Mobile-first touch handling (`touch-action: pan-y`, `dragPropagation`) is critical for Wizard components.
